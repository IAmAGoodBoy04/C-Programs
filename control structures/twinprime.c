/*Twin primes are consecutive odd numbers, both of which are prime numbers. Write a program which inputs two positive integers A and B and outputs all twin primes in range A to B.     A   = 51     B=97            51 53   ,   53 55 ,        â€¦.. 95..97

 A twin prime are those numbers which are prime and having a difference of two ( 2 ) between the two prime numbers. In other words, a twin prime is a prime that has a prime gap of two. */
